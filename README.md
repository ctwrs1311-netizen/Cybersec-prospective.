# Cybersec-prospective.
A project for a cybersecurity student starting from zero.
Project Introduction
The objective of this project was to establish a fully regulated network interface by implementing custom firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. This setup enables real-time log monitoring to identify suspicious patterns, while also utilizing a reserved IP pool configuration to redirect and neutralize external attacks, preventing them from reaching critical system assets.

🔍 Modeling and Evaluation
For this project, I designed a Stateful Firewall Configuration using logical rule-sets and log-parsing scripts.

Models Used: Rule-based access control lists (ACLs) and automated traffic redirection logic.

Evaluation Metrics: The system was evaluated based on Packet Inspection Accuracy and Response Time for neutralizing unauthorized connection attempts using the reserved IP strategy.

🏁 Conclusion
I recommend implementing this regulated interface structure as a baseline for any network exposed to untrusted traffic. To expand this project, I plan to integrate an automated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that can dynamically update firewall rules based on real-time threat intelligence feeds.
